# React Native todo app

Just a simple todo app to display how React Native works.

## How to run it locally

Fork the repository and clone the project locally.

`$ npm i` will install all the required dependencies

`$ npm start` will start a tunnel on localhost where you can scan a QR code with your `expo` app on the phone to see the project directly on a native environment.
